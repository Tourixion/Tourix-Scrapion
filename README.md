Howdy, fellas. (This is in English because I enjoy it)

Welcome to Tourixion, if you are reading this and you are not me. You are probably you. Joking Aside, this is a basic automation scraper using Selenium. Scrapy is the doer and the workflow sets up how the actions work. 
If you are reading this I am either // A) Introducing this to you, // or // B) Something has changed in the website we are getting data from.

Normally I would have an SOP, I probably made one. Regardless since you are here, that simply means you are having issues.

Checklist of Possible likely problems
1) The website changed its form thus forcing you to suffer, keep calm download the selenium extension and manually play out the actions then study the code to edit the one in the project.
2) We stopped paying for local clarity (Tbh Skill Issue)
3) Someone deleted the files (I am planning to add backups for the other aspects of the code here (If I remember to do so(I did, this almost certainly an older version but it has all the basic structure you can probably figure it out)))
4) The libraries we use have fully deprecated and everything is broken (Legacy skill issue)
5) Bugs : I have suffered and so will you!
6) Some change in the way the wesbsite works: I suffered tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

What can you do?
Scream!
Tell everyone hi from from the Past tell them Ai OG (They will have no idea what this means, but if you are here you probably know what an OG is forcing you to explain this term, except if it is very very far in the future)
